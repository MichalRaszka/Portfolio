# First Portfolio



Welcome to my first portfolio. Everything was built by pure HTML, CSS, JS including some helpful libraries: 
  
  - bootstrap 
  - animate.css
  - particles.js
  - typeit.js

...which makes my website more 'dynamic'. The usage of plugins was converted to my custom options. Whole page was designed by me using third party graphic design tools.
